# YAMTGA - Yet Another "Magic: The Gathering" App

YAMTGA aims to be a lightweight, fully-featured, and open-source Magic: The Gathering library management and deck-building tool.

This project is in *active development*, so please check back in occasionally for new releases as they become available. Please take a look at our [roadmap](https://github.com/users/ryanpag3/projects/11/views/4) for current feature progress.
